# Overview
`Medium` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2022`

# Description
Can you get the flag? 

We know that the website files live in __*/usr/share/nginx/html/*__ and the flag is at   
__*/flag.txt*__ but the website is filtering absolute file paths. 

Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:63268/).

# Hints
None

# Solution
Knowing the different between absolute and relative file path traversal is helpful for this challenge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Absolute path: The complete, unambiguous route to a file or directory from the system root  
> Relative path: The location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory

A preceeding `./` designates the current directory and `../` designates the enclosing directory.   
If we are in __*/usr/share/nginx/html/*__ and we want to access __*/flag.txt*__, we'll use the path `../../../../flag.txt` to read the flag. 

Enter this into the text box and click the Read button
