# Solution
Using the provided link, we are presented with a simple login screen:

Let's try entering a random username and password (**using letters and numbers ONLY**)

We get a `Log In Failed` error message. Let's inspect the page and see what is under the "Sources" tab

There are three sources: `login.php`, `secure.js`, and `style.css`. `login.php` is what we want. It shows us how the 
login credentials are verified. We can see that there is a function called checkPassword. We need to find this
function and see what it is doing. Let's look at the `secure.js` file:

```js
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Here we can see that the function checks for a certain username and password. If the provided creds don't match,
the function returns false and presents the user with the `Log In Failed` error, which we received in the beginning.

Entering the username `admin` and password `strongPassword098765`, we succesfully log in and get the flag:
