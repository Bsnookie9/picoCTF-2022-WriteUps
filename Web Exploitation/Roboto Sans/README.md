# Overview
`Medium` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2022`

# Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55617/) out.

# Hints
None

# Solution
The first thing to think about with this challenge is the hint in the description

`The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website`

Understanding that website can have `robots.txt` files, let's see if this website has one

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Robots.txt is a file that essentially instructs web robots about locations within a web site that are allowed, not allowed, etc.

Here we can see a few things:
```
1. /cgi/bin path is disallowed
2. /wp-admin/ path is disallowed
3. ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW  
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==  
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
```

If you know anything about encoding, anytime you see `==` is a big hint that Base64 was used. Let's use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode:

```
ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg

flag1.txtjs/myfif§2ö×fÆRçG@/²Ë!®	h²÷Z²W£
```

Something is here but let's try each line from the original robots.txt file:

```
ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW --------> `flag1.txtjs/myfi`
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA== -----------> `js/myfile.txt`
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg --> `²û,²ðzè°¡¡»/u«%z8`
```

We can see that js/myfile.txt looks like a valid path, so let's try adding that path to the end:
