# Overview
`Medium` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2022`

# Description
The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it?

# Hints
How could you mirror the website on your local machine so you could use more powerful tools for searching?

# Solution
To mirror a website, you can use the `wget` command. However, we need to add a few extra parameters:

`wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://saturn.picoctf.net:53968/`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `--mirror` - Makes the download recursive  
> `--convert-links` - Converts all the links (CSS stylesheets, etc.) to relative, making it suitable for offline viewing  
> `--adjust-extension` - Adds sutiable extensions to filenames depending on their content-type  
> `--page-requisites` - Download required items (CSS style-sheets, images, etc.) to properly display the page offline  
> `--no-parent` - When recursing do not ascend to the parent directory; Useful to restrict the download to a portion of the site

After running this command, we can use the `ls` command to list files/directories:

```console
bsnookie9-picoctf@webshell:~$ ls
README.txt  saturn.picoctf.net:53968
```

We can see that a directory was created from our `wget` command.  
Using the `cd` command to change directories, we can again use the `ls` command to see what exists:

```console
bsnookie9-picoctf@webshell:~$ cd saturn.picoctf.net\:53968/
bsnookie9-picoctf@webshell:~/saturn.picoctf.net:53968$ ls
css  images  index.html  js
```

We could change directories and list files/directories to manually find the flag...OR...we could use a command to find it for us

We can use the `grep` command with some parameters to find the flag. Let's use this command: `grep -nr 'picoCTF{* .`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `-n` - Shows the relative line number in the file  
> `'picoCTF{*` - String to search, followed by a wildcard character  
> `-r` - Recursively searches subdirectories listed  
> `.` - Searches the current directory

This command presents us with the filepath and line number of the flag:

```console
bsnookie9-picoctf@webshell:~/saturn.picoctf.net:53968$ grep -nr 'picoCTF{*' .
./css/style.css:328:/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7} **/
```

# Flag
`picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7}`
