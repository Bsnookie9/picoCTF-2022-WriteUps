The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:52608/).

# Hints

# Solution
As the description mentions and the hint helps as well, there are hidden pages within folders.

When loading the first link we are provided, we can inspect the page using `ctrl` + `shift` + `i`

Then we can go to the "Sources" tab and see that there are assests in a folder called "secret"

Let's try moving to the folder in the path: `http://saturn.picoctf.net:55589/secret/`

Inspecting this page, we can see there is another folder called "hidden". Let's move to that folder:   
`http://saturn.picoctf.net:55589/secret/hidden/`

Lastly, we see another folder called "superhidden". Let's move to that folder:   
`http://saturn.picoctf.net:55589/secret/hidden/superhidden`

Where is the flag though? Inspecting the page we can see the flag is not hidden, but has white text in the css file
