# Overview
`Hard` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2022`

# Description
I made a nice web app that lets you take notes. I'm pretty sure I've followed all the best practices so its definitely secure right?  
Note that the headless browser used for the "report" feature does not have access to the internet.

# Hints
- Are you *sure* I followed all the best practices?
- There's more than just HTTP(S)!
- Things that require user interaction normally in Chrome might not require it in Headless Chrome.

# Solution
I had to look around this website for a while before trying to piece things together

First thing I discovered was the ability to inject HTML code while creating new notes:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9975f6c-56fe-41ec-ac77-e9a87f769b70" alt="Left Image" style="width: 35%; height: auto;">

</div>
